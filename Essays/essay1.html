        <h4>Ethics, UI, UX and Interaction</h4>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
          ENCA is a leading newsroom in delivering updated news across different fields such as politics, sports, and entertainment. In this essay, their website will be analysed with the use of UI and UX and the ethics of its interaction design will be deliberated on.
        </p>

        <p>“User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerised devices, focusing on looks or style” <i>(The Interaction Design Foundation, n.d.)</i>. This is the working definition that will be used to accurately describe the website’s interface. According to UXPin (2020), the first principle of UI design is to focus on the user and create an interface that is easy to use and meets their needs. This is executed competently by ENCA. The website has a simple layout with news stories organized into various categories such as Top Stories, Latest News, and Business News. The content is concentrated in the middle. Though there are cards that have one-sentence descriptions of the latest news articles, there is a separation between the ‘Trending’ container, ‘Top Stories,’ and the ‘Featured’ container. Over the ‘Top Stories’ container, there is another container with a question<i> (Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says LEAP officers will arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he enters the province. The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for war crimes. What do you think?)</i> that needs votes. It disrupts the user flow because two stories are blocked from the user. The user has no option to minimize this vote or to choose to not participate in the vote. The only way to remove that vote is to open the ENCA website in a new tab or a different browser.
        </p>

        <p>The website's overall design is responsive making it accessible to users on various devices.</p>

        <p>The navigation bar is clear and easy-to-understand with minimalistic labels for the different sections of the website. When navigating through the website, each webpage has a consistent 2-column layout. The first column has the ‘Featured’ and ‘Trending’ containers and the second column has the main content (what was labelled on the navigation bar). A large whitespace area makes the website feel less cluttered and more comfortable to navigate. This provides a strived-for clarity <i>(UXPin, 2020)</i>. There is a clear distinction between what is the primary information and what is the secondary information <i>(UXPin, 2020)</i>. The secondary information (the first column) is placed in a narrow column, not front and centre. Therefore, allowing the user to have an easy interaction with the website. The font size and colour contrast are also easy on the eyes, making it easier to read the content. </p>

        <p>“UX is described as a subjective, complex, and dynamic encounter that depends on the user's internal state, the characteristics of the designed system, and the context of the interaction” <i>(Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006)</i>. As ENCA’s UX design is analysed it is important to understand that a user’s emotions influence the user’s experience. Thus, one negative interaction can significantly impact the user’s well-being. This statement was said by Hassenzahl and Tractinsky (2006) in their essay when they discussed an example of call-centre software and the agents interacting with it.</p>

        <p>ENCA’s UX design is user-centric, with a focus on delivering a seamless experience for the user. The website's search bar is located at the top of the page, making it easy for users to find the information they need. The website's content is also well-organized, with clear headings and subheadings that make it easy to skim through the stories. The website has a social media sharing feature that allows users to share stories on their social media profiles. This feature is designed to make it easy for users to share content with their friends and family, increasing the website's visibility and reach. The website's load time is also impressive, ensuring that users can access the content they need quickly. This feature is especially important in today's fast-paced world, where users want instant access to information.</p>

        <p>The ethics of interaction design deal with how designers create products that meet the needs of users while being mindful of their impact on society. ENCA's interaction design is ethical, with a focus on delivering a positive user experience while maintaining an important level of professionalism and journalistic integrity. The website's content is presented in a way that is fair, balanced, and unbiased, providing users with accurate information. The website's search bar also allows users to find information quickly, which can be beneficial for users looking for specific information. However, one potential ethical concern is the website's use of cookies. Cookies are small files that websites store on a user's computer to track their browsing activity. While cookies can help provide a more personalized user experience, they can also be used to collect user data without their knowledge. There are no indicators (through a pop-up or a dialog box) that inform the user that the website uses cookies. This indicator is common amongst most websites. ENCA needs to ensure that they are transparent about their use of cookies and that users can easily opt-out if they choose to do so. </p>

        <p>In conclusion, ENCA's UI and UX design is well-organized, providing users with a seamless experience while maintaining an elevated level of journalistic integrity. The website's ethical concerns are minimal, with a focus on transparency and user choice when it comes to data collection. Overall, enca.com is a well-designed website that provides users with accurate and up-to-date news while delivering a positive user experience.</p>
