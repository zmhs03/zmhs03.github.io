<h4>Reflecting on Assignment One</h4>

        <p>
            When looking back at the website I submitted for Assignment 1, I can identify the things that did not go as I had planned and what did.  One of the main areas where I struggled was with the design and user experience of the website. The layout and visual elements were not as polished and engaging as I had envisioned. The navigation could have been more intuitive, and the overall aesthetics could have been improved to make it more visually appealing. The fact that I had not seen that my zoom was on 90% the entire time I was building the website disturbed me for a bit. I had only realised that my images were too big, leading them to not be viewable and the cards I created were compact. I struggled with organizing the content effectively. The information on the website was not structured in a clear and logical manner, making it difficult for users to find what they were looking for. 
        </p>

        <p>What did go right was with the functionality of the website. Despite the design and user experience issues, the website’s core functionality worked as intended. Users could access the necessary information and interact with some of the features provided.  The only thing that affected the functionality was the ‘mysterious’ change in paragraph spacing. Prior to putting all the weekly entries, I had dummy text in place so that I could construct everything first and then input the actual content at a later date but when it came time to do that it caused turmoil. And while I was grateful that throughout the building of the website, this was the only thing that was frustrating, I would like to blame myself for not testing out the code with the actual text for one weekly entry before carrying on.</p>

            <p>This is what I would do differently.
              
                    Before beginning development, I would spend more time preparing the website's layout, user experience, and content arrangement. Wireframes and mockups can be used to see the finished product and spot any problems before they arise.
                    I would definitely ensure that I continuously test my website with my peers and ensure that everything is conveyed in the way I intended for it to be.
                    I would give visual design elements, such as colour schemes, typography, and overall aesthetics, more time and consideration. The visual attractiveness of the website could be enhanced by soliciting user input or consulting design resources.
