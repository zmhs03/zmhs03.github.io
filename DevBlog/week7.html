            At the last minute I decided to change what my website would be displaying. Though this was my plan B. After reading the additional content relating to the assignment and hearing what was said in the Thursday lecture, I felt surer of my second plan than I di with the music-focused website. I needed to change a few things, namely, my colour palette, and replacing the music section of the website with a portfolio section. Through Thursday’s class I realised that I don’t need to have all the answers for the portfolio. I was acting like I did. I admit, it was a bit dangerous switching up the basis of the website, but it will be worth it in the end.

        </p>

        <p>
            The main reason why I changed concepts was because everything under the goal alignment was not clear. I was unsure of my target audience; I had a goal, and I could articulate it well enough, but it was still unclear to me, and I was confused on the content I wanted to display and how I wanted to display it. If my goal is unclear, then I could only imagine how bad the user’s experience would be. 


        </p>

        <p>

            Changing concept was the first step to a clear goal. I now know who my target audience is, and I am continuously trying to make a fitting website for that concept. I am planning to make the website denser as the user clicks through it. I will not be placing everything on one webpage, it would be jarring.
        </p>

        <p>
            Compact information and information that requires you to do an extensive read like the design section and the devblog section, will be placed in a way that is compact. The homepage will have my name on it. The about page will have the ‘About Me’ heading, a short paragraph and a picture of me and I will have the design section following afterwards (it’s title will be ‘Intentions’). The design section will have the content be separated and condensed into squares that will have a short description and a read more button. All the other pages and content will be in the navigation bar.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interaction points will mostly consist of buttons and scrolling, as well as hyperlinked resources and images.
