            I had set up Github last year for a group project in Digital Art Design Project. At that time I couldn’t really take the time to learn and understand Github because of the time constraints involved with the group project. However, since seeing that this course will be making use of Github, I decided to hone in on the information I got on the video linked.

            I was surprised by the readings we got. I had expected our first readings to have a focus on more current debates surrounding technology. Reading the readings especially As We May Think by Bush, really helped understand that we need to learn from the technology created at that time to understand where technology will be in future. I have to admit, these two readings were a bit overwhelming for me as they had a lot of jargon that didn’t help me understand the general idea of what’s being written. I highlighted the words and phrases I didn’t understand I tried my hardest to interpret what the readings were actually about and how they affect what we know now.

            I tried finding websites I liked to write in this blog, but I could only think about Netflix’s website. There is a clear distinction in usability on the website as opposed to the app. It feels so jarring to watch any type of series on the website. On the app, when you click on the card with the series title and its accompanying image, you’re immediately guided to a pop-up with more information about that series. But on the website, it begins the first episode. This only works for series or movies that you are watching already. There’s really no need to be taken to the info page. It’s quite annoying when you think about it because as the user, that action forces a series to be on the user’s watchlist.
