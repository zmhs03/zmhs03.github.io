        I started to visualise my website more clearly by using JustinMind to make a mid-fidelity mockup. I wanted to make sure that the direction I wanted to take wasn’t farfetched. I used Canva as a visualiser. I am an artist at heart, so I needed to see the exact layout of the website. And thankfully, it wasn’t horrific to look at. I had the idea of making the homepage a one-page scroll. The idea looks great on paper but since reading and watching the readings and lectures, I’ve grown quite unconfident in the useability of the website.

            The revisions I might need would be the carousel I want to put for the DevBlogs section of my website. My intention is for the information to become denser as the user scrolls down but I fear it may be jarring for the use to move from a home section (with a lot of white space) to a blog page with a lot of reading, even if the posts are placed in cards.

            Interactivity is quite important in the sphere of UI. There is a direct proportionality between the two. One affects the other. This also brings the question for designers on how their design could affect a user’s experience using the website. If there is too much information to take in, users may be overwhelmed and would not know what they need to look at first.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A good website is determined by user experience and that comes from the user being able to interact with the interface with ease. We need to keep in mind who our target audience is and what they need when designing our websites (Studio by UXPin, 2020).
