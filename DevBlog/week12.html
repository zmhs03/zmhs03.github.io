            Before deciding on the kind of API that would be useful for my website, I first assessed the needs of my users and the goals of my website. One potential API that came to mind was a social media API.Users will be able to publish stuff directly from my website to their social media profiles through the integration of social media APIs, increasing visibility and engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've thought about the challenge of managing and handling API responses effectively. APIs may have limits on the number of queries that can be done at every interval. I'll have to implement techniques like caching, request throttling, or batching requests to prevent the API from becoming overwhelmed and to provide a flawless user experience.
        </p>

        <p>

            Overall, even if incorporating APIs can significantly improve my website, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the associated technological difficulties. I can guarantee a seamless integration of APIs and give my users a better experience by proactively addressing challenges similar to the one mentioned above.
        </p>

        <p>The chapter "Traveling While Trans" from Sasha Costanza-Chock's book "Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need" struck a particularly poignant chord with me as I investigated the realities of transgender persons working in the travel industry. As someone who embraces diversity and believes in the transformative power of design, this chapter provided me with a devastating and instructive analysis of the challenges the trans community has with regard to mobility.</p>

   <p>The difficulties trans persons encounter when taking public transit made reading about them stressful and disheartening. Transgender people face a number of difficulties that are painfully evident, such as the work required to get identification credentials that accurately reflect their gender identity and having to put up with harassment and prejudice while traveling. Emphasizing how they continue to marginalize and reject transgender persons, the chapter unambiguously demonstrates the discriminatory behaviors inherent in the transportation sector.</p>
