            I had a bit of some experience with HTML from high school. We were not taught anything intricately nor did we have the creative freedom to do whatever we wanted. It was quite interesting to engage with HTML in a different way than what I am used to.

            The readings were quite hard to understand or comprehend when I first read them. But the second time I did, I understood that “Why You Should Choose HTML5” and “How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video” useability and accessibility within web design is quite important. The way users access information is the most important thing any web developer should keep in mind. For example, changing the exit button a dialog box from the bright red we are all familiar with to a neon pink would be confusing to a user because of the standard they are used to. Another example is information dumping in places where the information is supposed to be succinct and compact. A website that has images that don’t have alt text or does not accept text-to-speech, is a great example of not prioritising all users in the useability spectrum.

            The internet was quite simplistic in its design and in its use. Internet Histories gives insight into how we moved from the internet in its early years to where we are now. Before, there were multiple devices for different functions. A cell phone to make calls and to send SMSs, a CD player for music, Computer to access the internet and to browse on it. We now use one device for all those functions and more. We can download anything without waiting too long for it be downloaded on our devices. Accessing information is quicker and putting information on the internet is much faster than what we would have imagined in the early days.

            I found out recently that the first software engineer Margaret Hamilton, was the first programmer and she coined the term software engineer. As I looked at the picture of her standing with all of the code she wrote by hand (I am forever impressed by that), it got me even more excited to learn how to programme in HTML and the other languages.
