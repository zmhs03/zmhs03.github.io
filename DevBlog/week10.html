<h4>Javascript</h4>

            As much as I have put in that effort to get ahead with learning javascript, I quickly became overwhelmed by it. I had revisited the exercises we have been doing whilst learning Javascript and have been slowly growing accustomed to the language as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>The website has taken a backburner so that I could really think about how I would want to implement Javascript, whilst also giving me the time to return and fix the issues when I had submitted the first assignment.</p>

        <p>
            While reading <i>Mohamed et al. - 2020 - Decolonial AI Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical</i>, I became fascinated at the coincidence,firstly, because in other courses there have been assignments and eiscussions surrounding AI and its influence on scoiety.The paper provides insight into the intersectionality of AI and decolonial theory. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The paper highlights the need for AI to developed through a decolonized lens to ensure that the builder's unconscious bias, as well as stereotypes, and hateful behaviour is not integrated with the AI and it is as fairly as possible. As I read and understood that, I began to look at AI as though it was a parrot. It could only repeat the information given to it by it's builder and it cannot conjure up new information.
