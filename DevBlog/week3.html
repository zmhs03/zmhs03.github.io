            I am quite picky when it comes to anything that has to do with aesthetics. I had an image of how I wanted my website to look but I was conflicted because I wasn’t sure of how I would implement the portfolio aspect. I was thinking of changing the portfolio section of my website to music or changing it overall to a music themed website. I am feeling a bit intimidated by the whole idea of just having a completed website.

            While we were learning the basics of CSS, I took the time to look at different portfolio websites to draw inspiration. There were quite a few elements I liked that I wanted to try out on my own website (Linked websites at the bottom of the post). Hopefully, I could try them out on my own, without sacrificing what I have in mind.

            The reading was quite an interesting way to begin with UI and UX. I have had quite an interest with UI and UX and I have been making side comments whenever the useability of an app or game would be jarring. This reading, as well as the lecture were like a knowledge fountain for me. There quite a few things that I hadn’t considered like the idea of users not particularly liking a feature because of how different it is from the norm. Instagram was the first thing that came to mind after watching the lecture. When they moved the notification icon to the upper-right hand corner of the home page from its familiar position and replaced with a shopping icon, it caused havoc. Users, including myself, were irritated at having to adjust just for the next update to change it up. This has been ongoing. The plus sign used to be in the upper-left corner (for quite for some time too) and it has been moving and forth from that position to its current position (as of this update). A lot of engagement on the app has decreased and I believe this is partially why.

            I use the supplementary material to better understand and add more knowledge to the pool. The perspectives are drastically different which I think is quite helpful in learning. Its like learning how to solve a sum using one method. If you don’t have different methods under your belt, when you are confronted with a sum that you can’t solve using that <b>one</b> method its quite difficult to overcome it and solve the sum.
