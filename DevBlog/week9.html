            I had been having quite a tough time with balancing between working on the website and going through this week's content because I am stuck on how I could improve the website as well as do everything to the best of my abilities. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Rather than spending the time fixated over the lack of progress with the website, I decided to start working on my portfolio works. In the beginning of the year I had started learning Javascript through Codeacdemy and I had a list of projects I could try out to test my abilities and mhy understanding. However, since we started learning Javascript as part of the course I decided against getting ahead of others. I, however have started learning the basics of Python, in an effort to have another language under my belt. Granted I would have 5 languages (C# included) written in my CV as part of my technical skills.  
        </p>

        <p> While I was unable to attend last week's lecture due to a family emergency, I did make up the missed time by reading the readings. The task that had to be done at hand confused me so I settled on putting in extra hours for the website instead, whilst making sure that I have read all of these readings.
        </p>

        <p><i>I have referenced the readings that sparked my interest</i></p>
